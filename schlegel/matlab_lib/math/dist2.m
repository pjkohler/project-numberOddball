function d2 = dists(x,y)
% DIST2
% 
% Description:	calculates the square of the distance between points in N-space
% 
% Syntax:	d = dist2(x,y)
%
% In:
%	x	- an M1 x ... x Mk x N array of points in N space
%	y	- either a matrix the same size as x or an N length vector representing a single point in N space
% 
% Out:
%	d2	- an M1 x ... x Mk array of distances between x and y
