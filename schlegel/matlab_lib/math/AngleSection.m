function k = AngleSection(a,s)
% ANGLESECTION
% 
% Description:	determine to which of the sections defined in s the angles in a
%				belong.
% 
% Syntax:	k = AngleSection(a,s)
%
% In:
%	a	- a matrix of angles
%	s	- the angle section cutoffs.  s is assumed to be increasing
% 
% Out:
%	k	- the s section to which each a belongs.  section 1 is the section with
%		  angles less than s(1) or greater than s(2)
