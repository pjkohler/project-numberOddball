function [kPeaks,vPeaks] = FindAllPeaks(x,fs,varargin)
% FindAllPeaks
% 
% Description:	find all the peaks in signal x
%
% Syntax:	[kPeaks,vPeaks] = FindAllPeaks(x,fs,[hw]=<determine>,[bAboveMean]=true,
%										[bDebug]=false)
% 
% In:
%	x				- the signal
%	fs				- the sampling frequency of the signal
%	[hw]			- the width at half max of the gaussian kernel with which to
%					  filter the data prior to looking for peaks, in ms.  if
%					  unspecified, the function calculates this value from the
%					  highest frequency component with significant power in the
%					  signal (i.e. I hope to filter out noise but keep the
%					  frequencies that make up the signal).  Set==0 to skip
%					  filtering
%	[bAboveMean]	- true to only consider values that are at or above the
%					  signal mean (for signals that oscillate around a fixed
%					  point)
%	[bDebug]		- true to display a debug plot
% 
% Out:
%	kPeaks	- the indices in x at which peaks occur
%	vPeaks	- the values of those peaks
