function fs = GetSamplingFrequency(t)
% GetSamplingFrequency
% 
% Description:	get the sampling frequency based on a time vector t (in s)
% 
% Syntax:	fs = GetSamplingFrequency(t)
%
% Assumptions:	Assumes t is an almost uniform array, e.g. an array the steps
%				the same amount from one position to the next, except for sparse
%				anomalies such as a single large jump in the time value
