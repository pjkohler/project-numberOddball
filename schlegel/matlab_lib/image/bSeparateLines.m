function b = bSeparateLines(b)
% bSeparateLines
% 
% Description:	makes sure no more than three white pixels exist within any
%				3x3 neighborhood.  this will separate lines in a skeletonized
%				line image
% 
% Syntax:	b = bSeparateLines(b)
%
% In:
%	b	- a skeletonized binary image representing straight lines
% 
% Out:
%	b	- b with line intersections removed
