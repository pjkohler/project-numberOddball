% FILTERPREPARE
% 
% Description:	prepares a matrix for filtering
% 
% Syntax:	[x,ndN,f] = filterPrepare(x,f,[kInclude]=(all))
%
% In:
%	x			- a matrix
%	f			- the filter
%	[kInclude]	- the indices of elements to include in the preparation.  if
%				  this value is specified, x will be the size of k with an
%				  extra neighbor dimension
% 
% Out:
%	x	- x with a new dimension added and each element of each point's
%		  neighborhood ordered along that dimension, in column order
%		  of the filter
%	ndN	- the dimension along which the neighbors are ordered
%	f	- the filter made the same size as x so that points in the same
%		  position in each matrix correspond to filter values/neighbor value
%		  pairs.

%
% Assumptions: assumes x has already been padded, so that edge elements
%			   are filled with zeros
%
% Note: excludes neighbors with corresponding filter value==0
